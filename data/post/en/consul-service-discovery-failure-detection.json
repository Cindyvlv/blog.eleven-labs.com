To do that, we'll create a Docker Swarm cluster with the following architecture:\n\n![Consul Infrastructure Schema](/imgs/posts/2017-02-22-consul-service-discovery-failure/schema.png)\n\nAs you can see, we'll have 3 Docker machines:\n\n* A `Consul` machine (used for Swarm Discovery),\n* A machine that will act as our \"`node 01`\" with an HTTP service that will run on it (Swarm),\n* A machine that will act as our \"`node 02`\" with an HTTP service that will run on it (Swarm).\n\nWe'll also add on our two nodes a Docker container with Registrator image that will facilitate the discovery of Docker containers into Consul.\n\nFor more information about Registrator, you can visit: [https://gliderlabs.com/registrator/](https://gliderlabs.com/registrator/){:rel=\"nofollow\"}.\nLet's start to install our architecture!\n\n# Service discovery\n\n## First machine: Consul (Swarm Discovery)\n\nWe'll start by creating our first machine: Consul\n\nTo do that, just type:\n\n```bash\n$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox consul\n```\n\nOnce the machine is fully ready, prepare your environment to use this Docker machine and launch a Consul container:\n\n```bash\n$ eval $(docker-machine env consul)\n$ docker run -d \\\n    -p 8301:8301 \\\n    -p 8302:8302 \\\n    -p 8400:8400 \\\n    -p 8500:8500 \\\n    -p 53:8600/udp \\\n    consul\n```\n\nWell, your Consul is ready to receive your services and also our Docker Swarm nodes!\n\nBy the way, you can open the web interface by obtaining the Consul machine IP address:\n\n```bash\n$ docker-machine ip consul\n<obtained-ip>\n```\n\nThen, open in your browser the following URL: `http://<obtained-ip>:8500`.\n\n## Second machine: Node 01\n\nNow, it's time to create t`he machine that corresponds to `our first Docker Swarm cluster node and that will also receive the master role for our cluster (we need one...):\n\n```bash\n$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \\\n    --swarm \\\n    --swarm-master \\\n    --swarm-discovery=\"consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\" \\\n    --engine-opt=\"cluster-store=consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\" \\\n    --engine-opt=\"cluster-advertise=eth1:2376\" swarm-node-01\n```\n\nAs you can see, we've added the `--swarm-discovery`  option with our Consul machine IP address and port 8500 that corresponds to the Consul API. This way, Docker Swarm will use the Consul API to store machine information with the rest of the cluster.\nWe'll now configure our environment to use this machine and install a `Registrator`  container on top of it in order to auto-register our new services (Docker containers).\n\nTo do that, type the following:\n\n```bash\n$ eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-01)\n```\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d \\\n    --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock \\\n    gliderlabs/registrator \\\n    -ip $(docker-machine ip swarm-node-01) \\\n    consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\n```\n\nHere, you can notice that we share the host Docker socket in the container. This solution could be a [controversial](https://www.lvh.io/posts/dont-expose-the-docker-socket-not-even-to-a-container.html) solution but in our example case, forgive me about that ;){:rel=\"nofollow\"}\n\nIf you want to register services to Consul I recommend to register them using the Consul API in order to keep control on what's added in your Consul.\n\nThe `-ip`  option allows to precise to Registrator that we want to register our services with the given IP address: so here the Docker machine IP address and not the Docker container internal IP address.\nWe are now ready to start our HTTP service. This one is located under the \"ekofr/http-ip\" Docker image which is a simple Go HTTP application that renders \"hello, <ip>\" with the IP address of the current container.\n\nIn order to fit this article needs, we will also create a different network for the two Docker machines in order to clearly identify IP addresses for our two services.\n\nLet's create a new network concerning our first node:\n\n```bash\n$ docker network create \\\n     --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 network-node-01\n```\n\nthen you can use the newly created network to be used with your HTTP service container:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d \\\n    --net network-node-01 \\\n    -p 80:8080 \\\n    ekofr/http-ip\n```\n\nBefore executing the same steps for our second node, we will ensure that our HTTP service works:\n\n```bash\n$ curl http://localhost:80\nhello from 172.18.0.X\n```\n\n## Third machine: Node 02\n\nWe'll now repeat most steps we've ran for our first node but we'll change some values. First, create the Docker machine:\n\n```bash\n$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox \\\n    --swarm \\\n    --swarm-discovery=\"consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\" \\\n    --engine-opt=\"cluster-store=consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\" \\\n    --engine-opt=\"cluster-advertise=eth1:2376\" swarm-node-02\n```\n\nPrepare your environment to use this new node 02 machine and install Registrator container on it:\n\n```bash\n$ eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-02)\n```\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d \\\n    --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock \\\n    gliderlabs/registrator \\\n    -ip $(docker-machine ip swarm-node-02) \\\n    consul://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500\n```\n\nNow, create the new network and launch your HTTP service:\n\n```bash\n$ docker network create \\\n    --subnet=172.19.0.0/16 network-node-02\n```\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d \\\n    --net network-node-02 \\\n    -p 80:8080 \\\n    ekofr/http-ip\n```\n\nWe are all set! We can now discover what Consul brings to us.\n\n# DNS Request\n\nIndeed, you can now resolve your service hostname `http-ip.service.consul` by using the DNS server brought by Consul and you should see your two services appearing as a DNS record:\n\n```bash\n$ dig @$(docker-machine ip consul) http-ip.service.consul\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;http-ip.service.consul. IN A\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nhttp-ip.service.consul. 0 IN A 192.168.99.100\nhttp-ip.service.consul. 0 IN A 192.168.99.102\n```\n\nIn other words, a kind of load balancing will be done on one of these services when you'll try to join them `http://http-ip.service.consul`.\n\nOk, but what about the load balancing repartition? Are we able to define a priority and/or weight for each services?\nSadly, the answer is no, actually. An issue is currently opened about that on Github in order to bring this support. You can find it here: [https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1088](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/issues/1088){:rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n\nIndeed, if we look in details about `SRV`  DNS record type, here is what we get:\n\n```bash\n$ dig @$(docker-machine ip consul) http-ip.service.consul SRV\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nhttp-ip.service.consul. 0 IN SRV 1 1 80 c0a86366.addr.dc1.consul.\nhttp-ip.service.consul. 0 IN SRV 1 1 80 c0a86364.addr.dc1.consul.\n```\n\nAs you can see here, priority and weight are both defined to value 1 so the load balancing will be equal between all services.\nIf you add the Consul Docker machine IP address as a DNS server on your operating system, you'll be able to perform HTTP calls and see more easily what's happening on load balancing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl http://http-ip.service.consul\nhello from 172.18.0.2\n\n$ curl http://http-ip.service.consul\nhello from 172.19.0.2\n```\n\nHere, we have an IP address that corresponds to each HTTP service that we have registered so we can clearly see that we are load balanced between our two containers.\n\n# Failure detection\n\nWe'll now add a Health Check to our service in order to ensure that it can be use safely by our users.\n\nIn this case we'll start to return on our node 01 and suppress the container named `ekofr/http-ip`  in order to recreate it with a Health Check:\n\n```bash\n$ eval $(docker-machine env swarm-node-01)\n```\n\n```bash\n$ docker kill \\\n    $(docker ps -q --filter='ancestor=ekofr/http-ip')\n```\n\nRegistrator brings us some environment variables in order to add some Health Check for our containers into Consul and you can see the full list here: [http://gliderlabs.com/registrator/latest/user/backends/#consul](http://gliderlabs.com/registrator/latest/user/backends/#consul){:rel=\"nofollow\"}.\n\nIdea here is to verify that port 80 is opened and application answers correctly so we'll add a script that simply executes a curl command:\n\n```bash\n$ docker run -d \\\n    --net network-node-01 -p 80:8080 \\\n    -e SERVICE_CHECK_SCRIPT=\"curl -s -f http://$(docker-machine ip swarm-node-01)\" \\\n    -e SERVICE_CHECK_INTERVAL=5s \\\n    -e SERVICE_CHECK_TIMEOUT=1s \\\n    ekofr/http-ip\n```\n\nYou can do the same thing on your node 02 (by paying attention to modify the `node-01`  values to `node-02` ) and you should now visualize these checks on the Consul web UI:\n\n![Consul Infrastructure Schema](/imgs/posts/2017-02-22-consul-service-discovery-failure/checks.png)\n\nYou can also use the Consul API in order to verify the good health of your services:\n\n```bash\n$ curl http://$(docker-machine ip consul):8500/v1/health/checks/http-ip\n[\n  {\n    \"Status\": \"passing\",\n    \"Output\": \"hello from 172.18.0.2\",\n    \"ServiceName\": \"http-ip\",\n  },\n  ...\n]\n```\n\n# Conclusion\n\nYou are now able to install Consul on your projects architectures in order to ensure that services you contact are available and also be able to identify eventual issues that can occur on your services.\n\nIt's important to add a maximum of checks on elements that can make your services become unavailable (ensure that this one can be contacted and answer, ensure that remaining available disk space is sufficient, etc...).\nConsul is a tool that integrates well in your architectures by its simplicity of use and its powerful API.\n"}
