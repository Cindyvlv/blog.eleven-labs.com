two of them being the provisioning of additional resources\n(storage, queries, etc.) and unintentional wastage by developers or other teams.\nAnother difficulty with hybrid cloud storage costs is that different vendors have different pricing plans, with some\ncharging per data volume queried, making it difficult to estimate and plan costs in the short-term and long-term.\n\n[Netapp’s post](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/handling-storage-cost-and-cloud-sprawl) on handling the costs of cloud\nstorage can help guide you on the difficulty of dealing with cloud cost sprawl in a hybrid setup.\n\n### Complexity\nIt is a complex task to manage applications, data, and workloads in a hybrid infrastructure.\nFor example, an application workload might be in a public cloud while its data is housed within an on-premise data\ncenter or private cloud. In such a scenario, it’s imperative to ensure the application is built to access the data\nremotely the network connection between the two is not a bottleneck.\n\nA technique such as [copy data management](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/copy-data-management-CDM) can\nhelp to decouple data from underlying infrastructure and avoid issues with applications and data residing in different\ncloud systems.\n\n## Wrap Up\nThe decision about whether to adopt a hybrid cloud solution comes down to whether the pros outweigh the cons.\nBear in mind that there are solutions available to address the main cons of going hybrid and that the majority of\nenterprises favor a hybrid cloud implementation compared to going full private cloud or not using the cloud at all.\n"}
